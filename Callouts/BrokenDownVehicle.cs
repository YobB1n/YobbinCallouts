//BROKEN DOWN VEHICLE Callout by YobB1n, YobbinCallouts
//*ORIGINALLY UPDATED: July 22, 2020
//*REFACTORED: April 24, 2022
//*OBJECTIVE: Broken Down Vehicle blocking road, player must talk to the driver, then call a tow truck and clear the road.
//*REMARKS: This code is far from perfect, no bugs/crashes in my testing but it is certainally inefficient and there probably are unused variables and things that could be better. I'm new to this, I apologize.
//*Some Commented out code is for a future implementation of this code where I add an event where the player has the option to drive the Driver back to their house.
//*Comments, Remarks, or Questions, as well as Patches please use the LSPDFR Plugin Page for this Callout.
//*Thank You!
//*This was my first callout ever :)

//To-do: Detect STP, Use STP when 'Y' Pressed, get rid of old variables, finish vehicle old and vehicle exploded scenarios
